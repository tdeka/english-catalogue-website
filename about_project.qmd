## About Our Project

1922 is often considered the "Annus Mirabilis" or "Miracle Year" of Anglophone Literary Modernism, witnessing the publication of T.S. Eliot's *The Waste Land*, Virginia Woolf's *Jacob's Room*, and James Joyce's *Ulysses*. These now-canonical works were surrounded by a much broader field of print and a wide range of literary texts that were often more popular and more acclaimed than the books we study today. What was being published in the years leading up to 1922? 

*The English Catalogue of Books* provides a yearly record of books published in England according to *Publishers' Circular*, a trade publication of the British Publishers' Guild. This website provides a searchable database of records drawn for digitized issues of the catalogue published between 1912 and 1922.
