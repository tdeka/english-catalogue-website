<h1 class="page-top">About Our Sources</h1>



Each issue of the English Catalogue of Books begins with an excerpt about the publishing industry in that year, including information like the rate of publications throughout the year, what months were the most popular for book publishing, and other statistics. The excerpt also includes genre-specific information, such as increases and decreases in publications within specific genres. Below is the excerpt from the 1912 issue of the catalogue.

The excerpt page is followed by a table of statistics that states how many books were published in each genre and the total number of books published for that issue of the catalogue. This table includes information on how many of these publications were new books, how many were translations, how many were pamphlets, and how many were new editions. It also includes total publications for the previous year. Another table below shows how many books were published during each month of that catalogue year. Below are the 1912 catalogue statistical tables.
